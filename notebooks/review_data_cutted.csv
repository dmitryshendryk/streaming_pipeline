I work for a large online retailer named after a South American river, and ordered this because the ASIN (0000000868) is so ... distinctive ... and, frankly, I wondered what the hell a &quot;reader turntable&quot; was, particularly one with both an editor and an illustrator.A friend suggested that the title was really the result of a very poor translation; that &quot;Reader&quot; was supposed to be &quot;Tales&quot;, &quot;Turntable&quot; was supposed to be &quot;Lyrics&quot; and this was really a book entitled &quot;Korea's Favorite Tales and Lyrics&quot;. Oddly enough, there is such a book, apparently edited by Mr. Hyun and illustrated by Mr. Park.Well, as it turns out, &quot;Reader Turntable SE-14&quot; is not a book. It is, well, a reader turntable: a black rectangular piece of 1/2&quot; particleboard, about 13x16 inches, mounted on a bearing so it can rotate easily. It's a lot like a &quot;Lazy Susan&quot;.It's useful for reading rooms, libraries, etc. Place it on table, put a dictionary or other big heavy reference book on it, and now folks sitting on either side of the table can share the reference, simply turning it towards them when they need to look something up.Construction is sturdy. I (175 lbs) stood on it and it rotated: a bit roughly but it didn't collapse. Bearing quality is modest but serviceable.

I once spilled some cornflakes on the floor, and foolishly thought that I could clean it up by dropping &#34;City of Golden Shadows&#34; on it.  Not only did it not clean, it managed to make things worse by fragmenting the cornflakes into smaller and smaller pieces.  I did what any normal person would do: I stacked the other books on top, hoping that the combined power would whisk the cornflakes away to the technological wonderland that is Otherland.  No such results.Bin Otherland Empty, on the other hand, works like magic.  If you hook it up to a powerful enough motor, you can banish those cornflakes to the land of wind and ghosts.  The downside is that it's pretty light reading, but given the young adult trend these days it's following the light reading trend that literature is headed for these days.It's recommended that you get through the previous volume though (&#34;Hoover Electrical Vaccum Unit&#34;).  I mean, Bin Otherland Empty does work as a stand-alone, but it's not quite as absorbing when not paired up with the prequel.  Some people think you can skip the previous volume and lust stick your mouth in at one end and suck, but, c'mon, that's just gross.Spoiler alert!
